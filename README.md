# Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting heart disease using a dataset with patient health records. Using data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, we aim to identify significant indicators of heart disease and build a predictive model.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a heart disease dataset and applies data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning methods to build a predictive model. The primary objective is to determine significant health metrics associated with heart disease and create a model that can predict heart disease presence or absence based on patient data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv`, which includes various health indicators:
- **Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Blood Pressure**
- **Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, EKG Results**
- **Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise Angina, ST Depression**
- **Slope of ST, Number of Vessels, Thallium Test Results**
- **Heart Disease** (target label indicating Presence or Absence)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure the dataset file `Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv` is in the project directory.

## Usage
1. To explore the dataset and run the analysis, open `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

2. Run each cell to execute data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling steps.

## Modeling and Analysis
The project includes the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, categorizing features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming features for better model performance.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training models and assessing their accuracy.
